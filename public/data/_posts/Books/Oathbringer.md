description: 'The #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Words of Radiance, from epic fantasy author Brandon Sanderson at the top of his game. In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance. Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.'

## Thoughts

This is probably the weakest of the Stormlight archive so far. Through a combination of the book being long and having some lack luster characters. The trip to Shadesmare could have been cut completely, Shallan was really annoying in general and never really developed as a character. I could not stand her split personality and love triangle with Kaladin and Adolin. It was just annoying and I barely made it through her some times. Her having the split personality I feel also takes away from her character development.
This book is long like really long and I feel like it doesn't have to be that long. Adolin was surprisingly my favorite character. He has been growing on me more and more since the first book and seeing his growth has been great. With his brother and being a good character that I hope get some love in the next book as he has a lot of potential. I still rate this book so high as I was good to see Dalinar's character development from all three books come to a head and him confront the terrible person that he was in the past and overcome it. It made me like him less as a person seeing all the terrible things he's done be slowly revealed to us. But it made me connect with him more as a character and I really enjoyed seeing his arc play out. The book has it's problems but is a fun read that resolves a lot of the arcs from the first three books. I feels like the end of a trilogy and the beginning of a new one.

I really don't like the love triangle between Kaladin, Shalan, and Adolin.

Adolin might have the best arc in the book.

## Characters

#### [[Kaladin]]
Surgebinders
Captain of the [[Windrunners]]
I think that Kaladin is my favorite character in this book, his growth from book one to this one is immense
We can see him grow into a leader
Conflicted soldier who does not like to fight, only fights to protect
Contrasted with Dalinar who wants only to fight for the thrill of battle
Wants peace with the [[Parshendi]]
I like the parts where we get to see the perspectives of other [[Bridge 4]] members, it really humanizes him
#### [[Shallan Davar]]
Annoying as always
I don't like that she has multiple personas that she has to use to do things
Kinda stops her character development
It's weird
Boring
Liked her more in [[The Way of Kings]]
#### [[Dalinar Kholin]]
This is his book
I really like his sections, it cool to see how he was in the past verses how he is now
This book has a lot of his flashbacks
And he was an awful person in the past
Loved killing and fighting, a drunk, abused drugs, and was a bad husband

#### [[Jasnah Kholin]]
#### [[Lopen]]
Herdazian
hilarious
Windrunner squire

#### [[Moash]]
