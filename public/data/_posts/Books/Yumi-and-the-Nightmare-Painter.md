description: 'From the #1 Kickstarter campaign of all time—#1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson adds to his Cosmere universe shared by Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive with a new standalone novel especially for fans of fantasy romances. Illustrated by Aliya Chen. There is a world. One of endless night, surrounded by an even deeper darkness. Filled with nightmares come to life, twisted shapes that slink to windows and ease open doors, sliding across floors to look down on helpless faces. There is another world. A bright world, so bright it burns. Filled with stacked stones that call forth miracles, raised by callused hands that tremble in their work, drained with each stone lifted, settled, lifted again. Between these worlds two souls connect. Collide. Entwine. A bridge. A path. A road to both worlds changing forever. Yumi has spent her entire life in strict obedience, granting her the power to summon the spirits that bestow vital aid upon her society—but she longs for even a single day as a normal person. Painter patrols the dark streets dreaming of being a hero—a goal that has led to nothing but heartache and isolation, leaving him always on the outside looking in. In their own ways, both of them face the world alone. Suddenly flung together, Yumi and Painter must strive to right the wrongs in both their lives, reconciling their past and present while maintaining the precarious balance of each of their worlds. If they cannot unravel the mystery of what brought them together before it’s too late, they risk forever losing not only the bond growing between them, but the very worlds they’ve always struggled to protect. Note from Brandon: Even for a compulsive planner like me, sometimes a story emerges like magic. Unexpected, unprompted. You build an outline in days, craft worlds during a compulsive daydream, and develop characters with a burst of imagination like the brief flash of a firework. That was Yumi and the Nightmare Painter for me. The unanticipated story of two people who find one another. May your dreams live as mine sometimes do.'

### Summary

_Yumi and the Nightmare Painter_ follows two protagonists from vastly different worlds:

- **Yumi**, a devout _yoki-hijo_ who summons spirits through ritualistic stacking of stones, lives in a world of endless heat, where tradition and sacrifice govern life.

- **Painter** (real name Nikaro), resides in a dark, mist-covered city plagued by nightmares. He is part of a secret order of artists who banish nightmares by painting them.

When a mysterious event causes them to switch places during their dreams (Yumi in Painter’s world, and vice versa), they begin to unravel a deep cosmic mystery involving their worlds, their identities, and the hidden dangers threatening both civilizations. As they spend more time in each other's realities, they not only grow closer emotionally, but also uncover secrets that could shake the foundation of both worlds.

### Final Thoughts

Brandon Sanderson’s _Yumi and the Nightmare Painter_ is a dreamy, tender, and surprisingly intimate fantasy novel that stands apart from his usual epics. Inspired by Japanese light novels and anime like _Your Name_ and _Spirited Away_, it tells the story of two people from very different worlds—both physically and emotionally—who are unexpectedly thrown into each other's lives, and slowly, beautifully, begin to change.

Yumi is a sacred figure in her world, a _yoki-hijo_ whose life revolves around summoning spirits through the careful, ritualistic stacking of stones. Her society treats her like a living god, but also isolates and controls her, leaving her little space to think for herself. Meanwhile, Nikaro—better known as Painter—lives in a haunting, foggy city where nightmares stalk the streets. He’s part of a secret order of artists tasked with banishing these monsters by painting them away. Although his world is more urban and modern in tone, it’s no less emotionally heavy. Painter is deeply lonely, disconnected, and weighed down by guilt over past mistakes.

When an inexplicable event causes their consciousnesses to swap places while dreaming—Yumi wakes up in Painter’s world, and vice versa—the two are forced to navigate each other’s lives. What begins as a confusing and awkward arrangement slowly becomes something deeper: a journey of self-discovery, healing, and mutual growth. As they learn to understand each other’s traumas and strengths, their bond deepens into a gentle, deeply earned romance.

The novel’s pace is much quieter than what many might expect from Sanderson. This is no sprawling battle epic or fast-paced heist. Instead, the story unfolds like a watercolor painting—slow, deliberate, and full of small emotional beats. The central mystery connecting their two worlds unravels gradually, touching on classic Sandersonian themes like identity, duty, the cost of tradition, and the power of art. But here, the ideas feel more personal than usual. Painter’s internal struggles with depression and creative burnout are painfully relatable, and Yumi’s desire to live for herself rather than for others is equally resonant.

Stylistically, the novel feels lighter—Painter narrates much of the story in a conversational, almost journal-like tone that lets Sanderson experiment with humor, vulnerability, and introspection in a way that feels new. It’s a fresh voice, but it still has that familiar Sanderson polish when it comes to magic systems, twists, and satisfying conclusions. And yes, for those keeping track, it is very much part of the Cosmere, though the connections remain subtle unless you’re looking for them.

The worldbuilding in _Yumi_ is lush and imaginative, if slightly softer around the edges. Yumi’s lava-covered world of floating cities and spiritual rituals contrasts sharply with Painter’s neon-hazed metropolis crawling with psychological horrors. Yet both places feel grounded by the protagonists who inhabit them. There’s also a bit of levity in the form of Design, a spren-like AI companion with a chaotic sense of humor, who adds welcome comic relief while pushing Painter out of his emotional shell.

Some readers may find the story slow to start or be put off by Painter’s early grumpiness, but those who stick with it are rewarded with one of Sanderson’s most emotionally fulfilling conclusions. The romance, in particular, stands out—not rushed, not overwrought, just quietly and beautifully developed over time. It’s the kind of story that makes you want to hold your breath at the small moments: a shared laugh, a quiet confession, a hand reaching out.

In the end, _Yumi and the Nightmare Painter_ is a story about connection—between people, between worlds, and between art and meaning. It might not be the flashiest entry in the Cosmere, but it just might be one of the most heartfelt. For fans of introspective fantasy, gentle romance, or stories that linger long after the final page, this is a gem worth savoring.
