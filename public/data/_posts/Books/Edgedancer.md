description: 'From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, a special gift edition of Edgedancer, a short novel of the Stormlight Archive (previously published in Arcanum Unbounded). Three years ago, Lift asked a goddess to stop her from growing older--a wish she believed was granted. Now, in Edgedancer, the barely teenage nascent Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness, court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can''t help heading to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift knows she must seize this awesome responsibility.

## Thoughts

I think that this was my least favorite book from [[Brandon Sanderson]] so far. I didn't really connect with the main character Lift. I think that it was her age with her being so young and immature.
The purpose of this book was to really introduce [[Nale]] and Lift to the series. We saw Nale rescue [[Szeth]] at the end of the last book but I liked seeing what happened to him. I like Szeth and I am excited to see the rest of his arc.

## Characters

#### [[Lift]]
Child
A little bit annoying
I do like how she calls surge binding being awesome
I hope she doesn't become a main person
