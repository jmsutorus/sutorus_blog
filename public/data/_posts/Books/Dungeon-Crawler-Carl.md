description: 'The apocalypse will be televised! Welcome to the first book in the wildly popular and addictive Dungeon Crawler Carl series by Matt Dinniman—now with bonus material exclusive to this print edition. You know what’s worse than breaking up with your girlfriend? Being stuck with her prize-winning show cat. And you know what’s worse than that? An alien invasion, the destruction of all man-made structures on Earth, and the systematic exploitation of all the survivors for a sadistic intergalactic game show. That’s what. Join Coast Guard vet Carl and his ex-girlfriend’s cat, Princess Donut, as they try to survive the end of the world—or just get to the next level—in a video game–like, trap-filled fantasy dungeon. A dungeon that’s actually the set of a reality television show with countless viewers across the galaxy. Exploding goblins. Magical potions. Deadly, drug-dealing llamas. This ain’t your ordinary game show. Welcome, Crawler. Welcome to the Dungeon. Survival is optional. Keeping the viewers entertained is not. Includes part one of the exclusive bonus story “Backstage at the Pineapple Cabaret.”'

# Dungeon Crawler Carl


### Setting and Premise

Earth is suddenly destroyed in a catastrophic event orchestrated by extraterrestrial forces. Humanity’s only chance of survival lies in competing in a brutal, galaxy-wide game show called **Dungeon Crawler World**. The survivors—those who happened to be indoors at the time—are transported into a massive dungeon system made up of multiple increasingly dangerous floors. Each floor contains monsters, traps, quests, loot, and rules similar to a video game, but the stakes are real: death is permanent.

This dungeon is broadcast across the universe as a form of entertainment. Contestants, known as crawlers, are forced to fight, survive, and entertain alien audiences who can influence the game through bets, sponsorships, and viewership ratings.

### Main Characters

**Carl** – An ordinary man who survives the destruction of Earth when he happens to be wearing only boxer shorts and holding his ex-girlfriend’s cat. Thrust into the dungeon, he becomes a fighter who relies on determination, wit, and improvisation to survive.

**Princess Donut** – Carl’s ex-girlfriend’s pampered, show-bred cat, who gains sentience and speech once inside the dungeon. Donut becomes a spellcaster and unexpectedly competent companion despite her diva-like personality and comedic arrogance.

**Mordecai** – A former highly ranked crawler who now exists within the dungeon as a guide and advisor. He helps Carl and Donut with game mechanics, though his motives are not always transparent.

**The Viewers and Game Organizers** – Various alien species who control, influence, and watch the dungeon as entertainment. Their approval—or disapproval—can shape the fate of the crawlers.

### Plot Summary

The story begins with the sudden destruction of Earth. Buildings collapse, and nearly all life is extinguished. Carl survives and finds himself transported into a waiting area of Dungeon Crawler World, with only Princess Donut in his arms. Soon after, both are dropped into the first floor of the dungeon.

At the start, Carl and Donut are given basic equipment and introduced to the system: classes, skills, health bars, quests, and rankings. Donut quickly takes the role of a mage-like spellcaster, while Carl becomes a melee-oriented combatant. The dungeon floor is a devastated landscape filled with monsters, undead creatures, and scavenging survivors. Carl and Donut realize that survival requires not only combat skill but also public appeal, as they are being watched by alien audiences who can send gifts or place bounties.

Carl and Donut form alliances with some crawlers but are constantly threatened by others who choose to murder and steal to gain power. They face early challenges such as completing quests, learning to fight effectively, and figuring out the deeper mechanics of the dungeon system.

As Carl gains experience, he becomes more capable and starts to understand the dark reality of the game. Many of the creatures and non-player characters (NPCs) in the dungeon are not artificial—they are living beings forced into roles for entertainment. The system is designed to be cruel, favoring spectacle and violence.

Princess Donut, though often self-absorbed and dramatic, gradually grows into a reliable partner. Her magic is powerful, and her presence adds both humor and heart to the story. The bond between her and Carl deepens as they survive repeated trials together.

Carl also becomes aware of how alien viewers influence the show. His actions, personality, and choices affect his popularity score, which in turn can bring valuable items or dangerous attention.

By the end of the first book, Carl and Donut successfully fight their way through the deadly challenges of the first floor, defeat major threats, and prepare to descend to the next level. They have grown stronger, smarter, and more aware of the moral and existential implications of the dungeon.

Their journey is no longer just about survival; it is about understanding the system, protecting each other, and exposing the cruel nature of the game—even if doing so puts them at odds with the powerful beings running it.
