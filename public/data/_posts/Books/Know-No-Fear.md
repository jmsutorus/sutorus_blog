description: 'Mustering for war against the orks, the Ultramarines Legion is attacked by the Word Bearers on the planet of Calth, and the forces of Chaos openly reveal their part in the Heresy. Unaware of the wider Heresy and following the Warmaster’s increasingly cryptic orders, Roboute Guilliman returns to Ultramar to muster his Legion for war against the orks massing in the Veridian system. Without warning, their supposed allies in the Word Bearers Legion launch a devastating invasion of Calth, scattering the Ultramarines’ fleet and slaughtering all who stand in their way. This confirms the worst scenario Guilliman can imagine – Lorgar means to settle their bitter rivalry once and for all. As the traitors summon foul daemonic hosts and all the forces of Chaos, the Ultramarines are drawn into a grim and deadly struggle in which neither side can prevail.'

### Summary

### Favorite Quotes

- [3] Quote One

### First Impressions
First half of the book is just Pearl Harbor
Lots of characters that the book is juggling
Does a good job of fleshing them all out
My second intro to the Ultramarines

### Final Thoughts

Know No Fear by Dan Abnett was a great read. It started as a a Pearl Harbor type attack story with a minute by minute description of what was happening This really built up the anticipation of waiting for the attach to happen and introduced us to all the characters. Once this part of the book ends and it is allowed to breathe is where the book shines as the character building is really good. One of the better Horus Hersey books. Kor Phaeron is the worst I hate him.
