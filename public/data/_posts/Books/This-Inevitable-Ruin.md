description: 'NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Carl and Princess Donut are ready to battle it out in the epic seventh book in the Dungeon Crawler Carl series—now with bonus material exclusive to this print edition! The ninth floor. Faction Wars. Nine armies enter, led by rich and powerful aliens from across the galaxy. The winning team must capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, betrayal . . . It all makes for great fun and even greater television. But thanks to Carl, Donut, and Katia, this season is different. For the first time ever, the crawlers have their own army. The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and have formed an unprecedented team of their own. And it’s not just the crawlers who are at risk this Faction Wars. Any combatant who dies on the battlefield stays in the ground. For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. No matter who wins the war, only one of them will be allowed to leave this level. If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two. This is it. This is what they’ve been fighting toward. This is war.'

### Plot Summary

As Carl and his team enter the Faction Wars, they are thrust into a brutal contest where survival is paramount. The nine factions, each with their own agendas, engage in constant battles for dominance. Carl assumes the role of Warlord, managing resources, forging alliances, and making strategic decisions that will determine the team's fate.

Amidst the warfare, Carl uncovers a **grim truth**: the dungeon's creators have been exploiting human brains for resources, using the Faction Wars as a means to harvest valuable elements. This revelation shifts Carl's mission from mere survival to dismantling the corrupt system from within.

The introduction of **Atrocity-class spells**, particularly Donut's devastating **War Crime**, adds a new layer of complexity. While these spells offer immense power, they come at a significant moral and psychological cost, forcing the team to confront the true price of their actions.

As the conflict intensifies, Katia faces a harrowing decision: only one of her companions will be allowed to leave the level. This choice underscores the personal sacrifices and ethical dilemmas that permeate the narrative.

In the climax, alliances are tested, and the true nature of the dungeon's creators is exposed. Carl and his allies must navigate a web of deceit, power struggles, and existential threats to survive and resist the system that seeks to control them.

The novel concludes with the survivors reflecting on their journey, the losses they've endured, and the uncertain future ahead. The Faction Wars may have ended, but the battle against the dungeon's creators is far from over.
