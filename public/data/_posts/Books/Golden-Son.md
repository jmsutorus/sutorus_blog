### Summary

### **Setting**

Set in a dystopian future where humanity has colonized the solar system, _Red Rising_ takes place primarily on Mars. Society is structured into a rigid caste system, with the ruling _Golds_ at the top and the laboring _Reds_ at the bottom. The story follows Darrow, a lowly _Red_ who toils beneath Mars’ surface, believing his work is crucial to terraforming the planet for future generations. However, he soon discovers that Mars is already habitable, and his people have been deceived and enslaved for generations.

### **Plot Overview**

Darrow's life takes a tragic turn when his wife, Eo, is publicly executed for defying the oppressive rule of the _Golds_. Inspired by her dream of a free world, Darrow is recruited by a rebel group known as the _Sons of Ares_. They surgically transform him into a _Gold_—enhancing his physique, intelligence, and appearance—to infiltrate their society and dismantle it from within.

Darrow gains entry into the Institute, an elite academy where the best and brightest _Golds_ are trained to become future rulers. The Institute is less of a school and more of a brutal war game, where students are divided into houses and forced to wage battle against one another in a ruthless test of leadership, strategy, and survival.

Darrow quickly proves himself to be a cunning and ruthless leader, forming alliances with outcasts while learning to navigate the treacherous world of the _Golds_. However, he also begins to recognize complexity within his enemies, questioning whether all _Golds_ are inherently evil. He earns the respect of figures like Mustang and Cassius but also makes powerful enemies, including the sadistic and ambitious _Gold_ known as the Jackal.

As the Institute’s war games escalate, Darrow maneuvers his way to victory, defeating his rivals through a mix of strategy, manipulation, and brute force. By the novel’s end, he has risen to prominence among the _Golds_, securing a place in the upper echelons of their society—his first step toward bringing it down from within.
