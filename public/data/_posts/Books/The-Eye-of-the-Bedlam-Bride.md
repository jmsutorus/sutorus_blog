description: 'NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Carl and Princess Donut journey into insanity in the wildly entertaining sixth book in the Dungeon Crawler Carl series—now with bonus material exclusive to this print edition! Coast Guard vet Carl and his ex-girlfriend’s cat, Princess Donut, have survived longer and leveled up higher than anyone ever thought they could in the galaxy’s most popular reality show, but after the shocking conclusion of the seventh level, it’s now anyone’s game. A pantheon of forgotten gods. An old grudge between a talk show host, an heiress, and the man they shattered along the way. A rapidly deteriorating AI system. An inconvenient tiara upon the head of a friend. It is bedlam on the eighth floor. The crawlers are given a new task: Find and capture six monsters, each of which will be turned into a card. The stronger, the deadlier, the better. At the end of the floor, the bad guys will also have decks, made of some of the most powerful cards available. So it’s crucial for crawlers to assemble the toughest squad possible. But, like always, there is a catch. There’s always a catch. If Carl and Donut want a winning hand, they’ll have to capture the most lethal and terrifying monster of them all: Shi Maria. She was once married to a now-missing god. Her special attack is known to drive one insane. They call her the Bedlam Bride. But even if Carl and Donut can capture her, they know all too well that just because someone has been captured, it doesn’t mean they have been tamed. Welcome, Crawlers. Welcome to the eighth floor of the dungeon.'

### Setting and Premise

Carl and Princess Donut have survived multiple dungeon floors and become some of the most famous crawlers in the universe. The story takes place primarily on **Floor 7**, which is part of the ever-changing, sadistic dungeon system broadcast as entertainment to alien audiences. This floor is themed around a collapsing, war-torn region filled with undead armies, warring factions, and deadly secrets. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, powerful alien factions and game administrators continue manipulating the crawl for profit, politics, and chaos.

A mysterious and terrifying entity known as **the Bedlam Bride**—an eldritch being of madness and prophecy—begins to play a larger role. Her influence affects the floor’s events, Carl’s visions, and the future fate of the crawl itself.

### Plot Summary

As Carl and Donut enter Floor 7, they are immediately thrust into a landscape shaped like a fractured, post-apocalyptic kingdom. Undead armies roam, city-states wage war, and a cult worships the Bedlam Bride. This floor is organized like a grand tournament and political chessboard—each faction seeking dominance while the dungeon’s administrators encourage chaos for ratings.

Carl and Donut are now celebrities, loved by viewers but hated by other crawlers and political groups. Their fame grants resources but also places a constant target on their backs. They must complete quests, gather intelligence, and navigate alliances to survive.

Carl begins experiencing visions and dreams connected to the Bedlam Bride. He learns she is not just a mythic monster but a being woven into the fabric of the dungeon’s creation. Her “eye” represents truth—dangerous knowledge that could unravel the lies behind the crawl.

Meanwhile, Donut contends with sponsorships, rival influencers, and maintaining their public image. Yet beneath her showmanship, she becomes increasingly protective of Carl, sensing the psychological toll the floor is taking on him.

The politics of Floor 7 escalate into open warfare. Carl’s party becomes involved in battles against undead hordes, corrupt nobles, and rival crawl teams. They uncover a conspiracy involving the dungeon’s organizers and alien aristocrats who plan to manipulate the outcome of the crawl using the Bedlam Bride for their own gain.

As the climax unfolds, Carl confronts both physical enemies and existential truths. He discovers unsettling secrets about the origins of the dungeon, the nature of the Bedlam Bride, and what is truly at stake for humanity. His choices begin to influence not just the game but the structure of the entire system.

By the end of the book, Carl and Donut survive the chaos of Floor 7, but the cost is high. They emerge with new knowledge, new power, and a growing understanding that the dungeon isn’t just a game—it is a prison built on ancient horrors. Their journey continues to the next floor, with the Bedlam Bride’s influence far from over.
