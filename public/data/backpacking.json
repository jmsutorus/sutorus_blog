There are many awesome campsite opportunities near these lakes, especially at Island Lake. Titcomb Lakes are situated within the gorgeous Titcomb Basin along the Titcomb Basin Trail. Many hikers opt to base camp at Titcomb Lakes for a few nights to explore the area. See if you can spot the Twins Glacier at the head of the basin!",

After 3 miles, the trail steepened considerably as we gained the ridge, transitioning from deep forest to subalpine meadows. The wildflower display was spectacular - acres of lupine, paintbrush, and avalanche lilies carpeted the slopes. We took a long lunch break at Panorama Point (mile 5.5) where the full scope of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness spread before us. The final push to Upper Basin involved some rocky switchbacks, but the effort was rewarded with a stunning campsite beside a crystal-clear tarn. We set up camp with plenty of daylight remaining, allowing time to explore the basin and watch marmots emerge from their burrows as the afternoon sun warmed the rocks.",

Once on the ridgeline, the trail became more of a route-finding exercise, with cairns marking the way across open rock. The views were absolutely worth the effort - Mount Rainier dominated the southern horizon while glaciated peaks stretched endlessly to the north. We encountered a family of mountain goats picking their way across impossibly steep terrain. The descent to Granite Ridge Camp required careful foot placement on loose rock, but we arrived at our campsite by mid-afternoon. This elevated camp offered incredible sunset views and we watched the alpenglow paint the peaks pink and orange as daylight faded.",
