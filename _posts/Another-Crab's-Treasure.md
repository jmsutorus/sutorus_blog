# Another Crabs Treasure


## Summary

## Final Thoughts

### Summary
This was a fun souls like game that prioritized fun over difficulty. If you are looking for a cute fun game were you get to play as a crab and kill stuff this game is fun. If you are expecting a sweaty souls like experience look elsewhere. While not easy this game is not overly difficult and has an assist mode for people who just want to wonder around the world and enjoy the game. The continuous references to other souls like games in here was very nice as it felt like a love letter in a way and would be a great first souls game as you can set your own difficulty with many controls to do so.

### Story
I enjoyed the story of this game. It was simple and had clear themes. The characters we met along the way were fun and memorable and I don't really have any complaints. Except that Krill kinda stinks lol.
I didn't like that the end that it didn't save and I couldn't interact with the events that happened at the end of the game.

### Gameplay
The fighting in this game is a lot of fun as the player has a lot of options to deal with enemies. You have a grapple, a parry, a roll, a hover, a pull, light and heavy attacks, and a ton of magic abilities; three of which you can have active at any one time. This gives players a ton of options on how to handle encounters. 

#### Difficulty
This game had a weird difficulty curve; the beginning is hard but by the end of the game bosses just fall over. The game felt best to play before the player had too many over powered tools. I used the combo of grapple -> claw -> slam -> fizzle and repeated until it was dead. In between these combos I would just maintain the bosses stagger and parry everything. It might just be parry. Parry is fun to use but way over powered. If you can parry the boss it applies huge stagger and can interrupt the bosses combo giving you an opening. The swim mechanic also felt over powered as you could swim over many attack that enemies had.

### Bosses
The bosses in this game are for the most part good. With some being a lot of fun to fight and others being terrible. The bosses that I enjoyed the most all had the same feel. The were not overly large and required my to have to parry or be destroyed by their combo. The large bosses in this game didn't really work as the hit boxes were weird and I could stand under them with out being hit by them. Throughout the entire game except for the first area the bosses just didn't have enough health as my combos were doing 1/4 of the health bar. Most of the bosses I beat on the first or second attempt. The mechanics of the bosses were fine they just need tuning. I started playing the NG+ and this problem felt solved as the numbers were tuned up.

### Bugs
I encountered a lot of bugs. The most annoying was that hit boxes were weird and for many enemies you had to learn what the actual hit box was and to not rely on visuals.
