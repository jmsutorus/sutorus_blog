description: 'Caprock Canyons State Park, located in the Texas Panhandle near the town of Quitaque, is a rugged and striking landscape characterized by dramatic cliffs, red rock formations, and wide-open prairies. This canyon system is part of the larger Caprock Escarpment, a geological feature that separates the Texas High Plains from the lower plains to the east. The park is home to the official Texas State Bison Herd, which roams freely across the terrain, offering visitors a rare chance to see these majestic animals in their natural habitat. In addition to its rich wildlife, Caprock Canyons features miles of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails that wind through its beautiful scenery, making it a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts seeking to explore the rugged beauty of West Texas.'
