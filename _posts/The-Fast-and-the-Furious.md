### Summary

### Favorite Quotes

- [3] - **Dom**: I live my life a quarter mile at a time. Nothing else matters: not the mortgage, not the store, not my team and all their bullshit. For those ten seconds or less, I'm free.

- [3] **Dom**: You almost had me? You never had me - you never had your car... Granny shiftin' not double clutchin' like you should. You're lucky that hundred shot of NOS didn't blow the welds on the intake! You almost had me?

### First Impressions

Fun movie with well developed characters. Dialogue was well written for the most part and it really sucked you in. Lots of cars but i felt like the movie was really about the people and the cars were secondary. Movie ended kinda abruptly and didn't flesh out the end

### Final Thoughts

### Key Takeaways

### Characters

#### [[Brian O'Conner]] 

Undercover cop who at the end of the movie takes the side of the criminals that he is hunting. Does he love the thrill of the race, the criminal rush, fallen in love with Mia, or Dom's aura.

#### [[Dominic Toretto]]

Dom only cares about his family and his cars. He's a criminal but is endearing with how much he cares about his family and honor. Gives off an aura that he will do anything for them.

#### [[Mia Toretto]]

Sister of Dom and Brian's love interest. She doesn't have much of a personality other than those two characteristics. 

#### [[Letty]]

Dom's love interest and girlfriend. She the tough girl.
