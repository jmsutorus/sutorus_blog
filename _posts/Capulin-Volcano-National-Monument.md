description: 'Capulin Volcano National Monument, located in northeastern New Mexico, is a strikingly well-preserved cinder cone volcano that offers a unique glimpse into the region''s volcanic past. The volcano, which last erupted about 60,000 years ago, rises over 1,000 feet above the surrounding plains, providing panoramic views of the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field and distant landmarks like the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Visitors can drive up the volcanoâ€™s rim, hike its crater, and explore the surrounding lava flows and grasslands that support diverse wildlife, including mule deer, black bears, and various bird species. Rich in both geological and cultural history, Capulin Volcano offers an immersive experience into the natural forces that shaped the southwestern United States.'
