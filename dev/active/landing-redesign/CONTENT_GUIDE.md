## üÜò Troubleshooting

- Check that image files have `.webp` extension
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Issue: Paragraph Breaks Not Showing

**Solution**:
- Use `\n\n` (two backslash-n) to separate paragraphs in JSON
- Example: `"First paragraph.\n\nSecond paragraph."`
- Not just `\n` or actual line breaks

### Issue: Content Still Shows Placeholder

**Solution**:
- Make sure you saved the JSON file
- Hard refresh the browser
- Check browser console for JSON loading errors
- Verify JSON syntax is valid (use JSONLint.com)

### Issue: JSON Syntax Error

**Solution**:
- Copy your JSON to [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate
- Common errors:
  - Missing comma between items
  - Extra comma after last item
  - Unescaped quotes in text
  - Missing closing brace `}`
